# ID5-an-Incremental-ID3

In this project, I have implemented the algorithm described in this paper: (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780934613644500177)
Instead of implementing the ID5 for a binary classification task, which was explained in the original papers, I implemented this algorithm for a multi-class classification task on the poker dataset.
You can fined the dataset that I used in the following link:
