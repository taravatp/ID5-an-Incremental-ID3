# ID5-an-Incremental-ID3

In this project, I have implemented the algorithm described in this paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780934613644500177</br>
This algorithm is coded from scratch, without using any libraries.

Instead of implementing the ID5 for a binary classification task, which was explained in the original papers, I implemented this algorithm for a multi-class classification task on the poker dataset.</br>
You can fined the dataset that I used in the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand
